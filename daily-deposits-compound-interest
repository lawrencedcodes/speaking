* Daily Deposits and Compound Interest: Keys to Building Long-Term Wealth In Tech

Many enter the tech industry believing it's a golden ticket—a guaranteed path to success. But the reality is that tech is a battlefield, not a chocolate factory, and waiting for a single, 
life-changing opportunity is a losing strategy. This talk dismantles that myth and argues that building a truly valuable and resilient career isn't about lottery wins; it's about applying 
the time-tested principles of building financial wealth to your professional life. We will explore why you owe yourself everything, why your starting point doesn't define your destination, 
and how to shift your mindset from waiting for a ticket to building your own empire, one brick at a time.

This session provides a clear, actionable framework for career growth based on two powerful concepts: Daily Deposits and Compound Interest. You will learn to identify the crucial 
"deposits"—the small, consistent actions in skill acquisition, networking, execution, and mindset—that you must make every day. We will then deconstruct how these deposits generate 
"compound interest" in the form of outsized returns in reputation, expertise, and opportunities you can't even predict today. Leave this talk with not just inspiration, but a practical 
system for taking control of your career and building long-term, sustainable wealth in tech.
