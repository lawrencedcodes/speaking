* How to Become a DevRel through Daily Deposits and Compound Interest aka Keys to Building Long-Term Wealth In Tech

Many enter the tech industry believing it's a golden ticket—a guaranteed path to success. But the reality is that tech is a house of many doors, less chocolate factory, and waiting for a single, 
life-changing opportunity is a losing strategy. This talk dismantles the myth and argues that building a valuable and resilient career isn't about lottery wins; it's about applying 
the time-tested principles of building financial wealth to your professional life. We will explore why you owe yourself everything, why your starting point doesn't define your destination, 
and how to shift your mindset from waiting for a ticket to building your own opportunities, one step at a time.

This session provides a clear, actionable framework for career growth based on two powerful concepts: Daily Deposits and Compound Interest. You'll learn to identify the crucial 
"deposits" - small, consistent actions in skill acquisition, networking, execution, and mindset—that you must make every day. We'll then deconstruct how these deposits generate 
"compound interest" in the form of returns in reputation, expertise, and opportunities you can't even predict today. We'll highlight the practical application of these principles
in how I've applied them to go from managing fast food restaurants to becoming Senior Developer Advocate at Beefree.
