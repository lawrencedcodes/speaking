* The Sculptor and the Marble: The Journey from AI Prompt to Deployed UI

AI can now generate UI code from a simple text prompt, like a beautiful block of digital marble. But what separates this raw material from a production-ready masterpiece? The answer lies not in better prompts, 
but in the skill of the sculptor—the developer. This session argues that in the AI era, the most valuable engineers will be those who architect the "sculpting studios": the systems that channel AI's raw 
creative power into polished, reliable, and human-centric experiences.

In this talk, we’re starting with nothing but a command line, where we will prompt an AI live on stage to generate the UI for a new product. We will then architect and code the "curation layer" in real-time, 
using an embeddable visual builder SDK to tame the AI's chaos. We'll give it brand identity, empower a non-technical stakeholder to make it perfect, and deploy the finished, human-curated UI to a public URL 
before your eyes.

Join us for a live, end-to-end journey from initial idea to live application. You'll leave not with just a playbook, but with a new philosophy on your role as a developer in the age of AI.
