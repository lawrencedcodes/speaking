* Control Freaks Don't Scale: How to Score Wins in UI Creation with Shared Workflows

We've all witnessed, or perhaps even embodied, the well-intentioned "control freak"â€”meticulously perfecting every pixel or policing every comma. 
While driven by a desire for quality, this approach inevitably bottlenecks workflows, stifles team creativity, and simply doesn't scale, leading 
to burnout and slowed innovation. This session will explore how these behavioral patterns hold us back when they emerge in UI/UX and content creation,
and diagnose the true costs of clinging too tightly to the reins.

It's time to shift from gatekeeper to enabler! We'll dive into the principles of architecting for delegated UI creation, focusing on establishing 
robust guardrails (not rigid cages!) and empowering teams with the right tools. Attendees will leave with actionable strategies to identify 
control-freak anti-patterns, effectively delegate UI and content tasks, and understand how modern solutions like embeddable visual builders and 
specialized SDKs can transform developers into architects of scalable, user-empowering systems. Learn to let go (the right way!) and build faster, 
happier, and more innovative teams.
