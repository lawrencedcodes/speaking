# Agents, APIs, and UIs OH MY!: How To Craft an AI-Augmented Content Workflow

Large Language Models excel at generating raw text but struggle with creating visually rich, brand-compliant user content. 
How do we bridge this gap? This session demonstrates how to build an AI agent that orchestrates content creation from start to finish. 
We'll design a workflow where an agent uses an LLM for copy generation, calls internal data sources, and then leverages a UI-aware SDK 
via its API to programmatically assemble a polished, editable email. Discover how to use an embedded visual builder as a "tool" for 
your AI agent, transforming raw text into a production-ready asset for human review.
