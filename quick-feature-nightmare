* When a 'Quick Feature' Isn’t: Deconstructing the True Cost of Your Unplanned UI

It starts with a seemingly innocent request: "Can you just add a rich text editor?" or "Let's show a few basic charts." Every experienced developer knows this story. 
The initial "build vs. buy" calculation seems simple. But sprint by sprint, the simple UI component snowballs. It needs to handle edge cases, meet accessibility standards, 
and soon, it requires its own admin panel to manage templates and permissions.

Before you know it, your team isn't just shipping your core product; you are now the accidental product manager for a sprawling, complex UI feature you never planned, 
budgeted for, or properly architected. This "unplanned feature" becomes a black hole for resources, and its code is the costliest of all—not in dollars, but in lost velocity, 
core product delays, and mounting technical debt.

This session deconstructs this common anti-pattern, following a "simple" UI component on its journey to becoming a six-figure roadmap hijacker and a solution to avoid this 
painful trap.
